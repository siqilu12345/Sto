# Stochastic Equation
This repository contains my work for solving a stochastic differential equation. I met this problem in reading a thesis, which talked about the climate system. The passage gave an example equation to illustrate the properties of SDE. I found it interesting so I learned the basic of SDE by myself, and completed the solving code and got the same result as the paper. I tried two different ways, Euler and Wiener.
